5129,Insurers have to pay for addiction treatment. Trump just has to enforce the law.,Trump,"President Trump  arrives in the East Room of the White House on Oct. 26 to speak and sign a presidential memorandum declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)
In an October report on opioidsâ impact on New England communities  The Postâs Joel Achenbach described the nationâs opioid crisis as âa decentralized disaster that authorities understand they cannot solve with handcuffs and prison bars alone.â Indeed  almost everyone  up to and including  President Trump   is on board â at least rhetorically â with the idea that the crisis must be tackled in a manner more comprehensive than the usual law enforcement approach.
Last month   Trump  declared the epidemic a public health emergency  calling it the âworst drug crisis in American history â adding that âaddressing it will require all of our effort  and it will require us to confront the crisis in all of  its  very real complexity.â
Strong words. Too bad Trumpâs administration wonât use a tool that is immediately available and could bring treatment to millions of Americans.
[ President Trump  thinks  he  understands addiction.  He âs wrong.]
The failure â or unwillingness â to use this weapon as part of a national opioid strategy flies in the face of Trumpâs pledge to spend âa lot of time  a lot of effort and a lot of money on the opioid crisis.â So far  the only effort to enforce key Parity Act provisions has come from private attorneys â but the lawsuits I and others are pursuing are not enough. Initiatives announced by Trump  or by Congress  may take hold at some point  but thereâs no reason for our leaders to wait. The law is there right now. It just needs to be enforced.","[TGT] arrives in the East Room of the White House on Oct. 26 to speak and sign a presidential memorandum declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency.

5263,Prospect Of U.S. Embassy Move To Jerusalem Worries Leaders In Middle East And Beyond : Parallels : NPR,Trump,"President Trump  appears poised to overturn decades of U.S. policy on one of the world's most delicate geopolitical spots: Jerusalem.
 Trump  phoned Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas Tuesday and notified him about his ""intention"" to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem  according to the official Palestinian news agency WAFA.
A Palestinian official told  NPR Trump  did not clarify when such a move would take place but promised Abbas he would soon present a proposal for Israeli-Palestinian conflict resolution.
The White House says  Trump  will announce  his  decision on the embassy's location in the coming days.
 Trump 's evangelical and pro-Israel supporters have been pushing him to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem  symbolically endorsing Israel's control over parts of the city that Israel captured in 1967 and that Palestinians demand for a future capital.
The  Trump  administration has said the question of moving the embassy was not a matter of if  but when.
If  Trump  moves forward on  his  vow  it will be a major reversal of long-standing U.S. foreign policy. The U.S. has long said the status of Jerusalem should be resolved in conflict resolution talks. No country in the world bases its embassy in the city  to avoid taking sides.
Successive American presidents have signed waivers deferring a congressional act calling for the embassy to be moved.  Trump  signed such a waiver in June  saying  he  wanted to give U.S.-brokered Israeli-Palestinian conflict resolution efforts a chance to succeed.
But in recent days  U.S. officials indicated  Trump  was considering moving the embassy or announcing formal U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

Before his election   Trump  frequently attacked former President Barack Obama for playing too much golf.
Last August  Graham became a fierce critic of   [TGT]   over  the president 's reaction to the violence in Charlottesville. The senator blasted  the president 's assertion that ""both sides"" were to blame  saying that this response has garnered praise from ""some of the most racist and hate-filled individuals and groups in our country.""
 Trump  fired back  writing on Twitter that Graham was ""publicity seeking"" and ""just can't forget  his  election trouncing "" after ending  his  presidential campaign last year before the first primaries.",Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
